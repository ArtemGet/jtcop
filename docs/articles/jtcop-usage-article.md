## Introduction

I more than sure that we rarther often change our job titles, projects,
teams, technologies, and each time when I open a new project I see the
entirely different picture of the project, and specifically, the tests.
You may wonder why it so important. Well, because the well-organaized
tests are like a good documentation, they are easy to read and easy to
understand. If I want to add something new to a project, I always look through
the project tests and always start from them. I don't insist here that we 
should write tests first, I'm just saying that tests are important for many 
reasons (which one?):


So we decided to create a tool that will help us to keep our tests
more or less consistent, easy to read and orginized by similar principles.
We even created a tool which help us to keep our tests according with the rules 
which we think are important for Java projects. I believe that the similar tool
might be created for other languages you like.

Of course, we aren't trying to say that our rules are the best and the only
way to organize tests, but we think that they are good enough to be used across
many projects and teams. And we hope that you will find them useful too.

* Background: Briefly explain the need for organizing and naming tests. Mention the challenges developers face without standardized best practices.
* Purpose of the Article: Introduce "jtcop" and explain how it fits into the landscape of static analysis tools. 

Other articles:

  We write tests for a number of reasons: To shape the design of our system.
  To ensure initial and ongoing correctness. Documentation. 
  - The article significances the importance of test naming "The name of the test is crucially important, particularly from a documentation standpoint. "
  - Never start a test name with “test”.
  - "Don’t be afraid to be expressive. If your test name needs to be really long then go for it if it’s clear what’s going on."
  - The article also suggests to split tests into three sections: Setup, Action, Assertion, (Or even more famous Arrange, Act, Assert). 
    Which also significances the importance of clear test structure.

  - **Best practice** of writing unit tests:
    - Unit Tests Should Be Trustworthy (fail when it needed)
    - **Unit Tests Should Be Maintainable and Readable**
    - Unit Tests Should Verify a Single Use Case
    - Unit Tests Should Be Isolated (Tests should be runnable on any machine, in any order, without affecting each other.)
    - Unit Tests Should Be Automated
    - Use a Good Mixture of Unit and Integration Tests

  - Use Test Driven Development Judiciously!
  - Measure Code Coverage
  - Externalize test data wherever possible (@Parameterized.Parameters)
  - **Use Assertions Instead of Print Statements**
  - Build tests that have deterministic results
  - Test negative scenarios and borderline cases, in addition to positive scenarios
- https://dzone.com/articles/importance-of-unit-testing (Importance of Unit Testing)
  - "testing ensures security, customer satisfaction, and saves money in the long run. Sometimes it can save lives as well"
  - !**"Use consistent naming conventions and test one code at a time."** 
  - "Make sure that there is a corresponding unit test case for a module if there is any change in the code. All the bugs must be fixed before moving to the next phase. It’s better to test as you commit a code to avoid errors. Focus more on the tests that affect the behavior of the system. "
  - "It takes less time to find and fix the bugs during unit testing"
  - "You end up with more reliable code as the bugs are fixed in the initial stage"

  - "localize every little mistake quickly and accurately as well as simplify the debugging process if any issue occurs"
  - "unit tests give the ability to detect errors at an early stage of the development process "

  - "Doing unit testing properly is a lot harder than people think."
  - Reason for Failure (Single resposibility principle by mocking all except the unit (class) itself)
  - Stubbing and Mocking (use stubs and mocks in corresponding cases)
  - **"unit test code is much more readable when it mirrors the code under test"**
  - **Variable Declaration Order** "It is much easier to read the test code if they stubs and mocks are defined in the same order as they appear in the class that is being tested."
  - **Variable Naming** (The variable names used to represent the stubs and mocks should be the same names that are used in the actual code.)
  - Avoid Over Stubbing
  - "A test should check a single interaction with the class you are testing. Now, this doesn't mean you can only have one assert, it means  you should have a narrow when and a wide then. "
  - This article also consider three different parts of the test: "given:, when:,, and then"
  - This article also mentions the importance of Assertions order (the same for mocking and stubbing)
  - **"A when:  code block or a then: code block should never contain an if statement."**
- 

Interesting from other articles (cites):
- "In this article, I am going to share an example of such a test app. You can do the same in your projects.
- "Technology stack: Netbeans IDE. Java. Maven."
- "developers either don't write unit tests at all, don't write enough tests, or they don't maintain them"
